# Text Analysis with NLP Techniques

## Overview
This project focuses on text analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It provides tools and models to process, analyze, and extract insights from text data. This includes tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition (NER), topic modeling, and more. The goal is to apply NLP techniques to extract meaningful information from unstructured text data.

## Features
- **Text Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare text for analysis by removing stop words, punctuation, and applying tokenization and stemming.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Classify text as positive, negative, or neutral using machine learning models.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identify entities such as persons, organizations, locations, dates, and more.
- **Topic Modeling**: Discover hidden topics in text data using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).
- **Text Classification**: Categorize text into predefined categories or topics using various algorithms (e.g., Naive Bayes and SVM) .
- **Word Cloud Generation**: Visualize the most frequent words in a dataset.
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Convert text into numerical features for machine learning tasks.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **NLP Libraries**: 
  - NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
  - SpaCy
  - Gensim (for topic modeling)
  - Scikit-learn (for machine learning models)
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, WordCloud
- **Other Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy
